Improve the application’s real-time functionality and overall user experience by implementing the following features and integrations:

Localization & Currency:

Adapt all content and services to reflect Indian standards, including language, time zones, and default regional formats.

Change the currency format throughout the application to Indian Rupees (₹).

Ensure all services, booking options, and suggestions are based on locations across India.

Payment Gateway Integration (Server-side):

Integrate a secure, real-time payment system allowing users to choose from common Indian payment methods such as UPI, debit/credit cards, net banking, and mobile wallets.

Ensure that all successful transactions are automatically deposited into the UPI ID 809674639-2@ybl.

On the server-side:

Generate a unique payment session or order.

Await server-to-server webhook callback from the payment gateway after payment is made.

Verify the payment status and transaction signature.

Upon successful verification, mark the order/booking as "paid" in the system.

Automated Email Notification:

After a successful payment and booking, automatically send a confirmation email to the user.

This email must include:

Booking details (ID, date, location)

Payment amount and mode

Transaction ID and status

Contact support info (if applicable)

User-Selectable Payment Methods:

Allow users to select their preferred method of payment during checkout (e.g., UPI, wallet, card).

Clearly display the available options with proper icons and input fields.

Real-Time Feedback & Accessibility Improvements:

Improve the interface to be responsive, accessible, and intuitive for all users, including support for screen readers and mobile accessibility.

Provide real-time feedback and status indicators during booking, form submission, and payment (e.g., loading indicators, error/success messages).

Data Validation and Error Handling:

Ensure robust input validation for all forms, especially during login, destination selection, and payment.

Address existing bugs where user inputs (like destinations or names) are not properly rendered or processed.

Reliability Enhancements:

Make sure that all modules handle network interruptions gracefully and resume where possible.

Log critical transactions and actions server-side for better monitoring and debugging.
